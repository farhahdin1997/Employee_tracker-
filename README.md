# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## What is the Employee Tracker
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).I have built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Future Developments 
For future developments of this application, I would ,like to add the following feautres: 

- Update employee managers
- View employees by manager
- View employees by department
- Dlete departments, roles, and employees.
- View the total utilized budget of a departmentâ€”in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
