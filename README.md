## 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

# What is the Employee Tracker
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).I have built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Short description of the purpose that lies behind the development and maintenance of the software, explaining Why it exists.
